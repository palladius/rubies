These are 3 apps.

* pasta is tough as it uses HOBO library with DRYML - awesome but difficult
* riclife is also tough as it has EVERY possible library. I was able to make it run (script/server gets to listen) but never work.
* septober is the easiest and well dockerized now.

First step is to study their Gemfile. Remember: bundle wasn't working back then so we can't leverage it.
